After an internal investigation, this individual is no longer with the organization.\"\\n \\nTexas Children's Hospital in Houston said Monday it stopped a nurse from seeing patients after she reportedly posted about a young boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s condition on an anti-vaccination group on Facebook, according to a statement.\\n \\nShe allegedly wrote about the case on the \"Proud Parents of Unvaccinated Children - Texas\" Facebook page, which has since been deleted. A concerned parent posted screenshots of the unidentified nurse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments on the hospital's Facebook page late Friday.\\n \\n \\n \\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy for us nonvaxxers to make assumptions but most of us have never and will never see one of theses diseases,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the self-identified nurse wrote, according to the screenshots. \"[F]or the first time in my career I saw measles this week. Actually most of my coworkers and the ER docs saw measles for the first time as well. And honestly, it was rough. The kid was super sick. Sick enough to be admitted to the ICU and he looked miserable.\\n \\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy no means have I changed my vax stance, and I never will. But I just wanted to share my experience and how much worse it was than I expected,\" she added.\\n \\n \\n \\nThe nurse claimed the patient had recently traveled to a region \"where measles is very common\" and speculated that he may have contracted the disease overseas.\\n \\nTexas Children's Hospital responded to the parent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s post on Friday, confirming that it was aware of the post.\\n \\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you for your post. We are aware of this situation and have started a thorough investigation.We take these matters very seriously,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the hospital wrote. It edited the statement later to add: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe views of this employee do not represent that of the organization.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\n \\nIf confirmed, the toddler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diagnosis would mark the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eighth measles case this year. More than 100 people have been diagnosed in the U.S. this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n \\n \\n \\nThe hospital issued a longer statement on Monday, saying it had reached out to children who may have had contact with the infected toddler.\\n \\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA patient treated at Texas Children's Hospital West Campus tested positive for measles. This is a highly-contagious, vaccine-preventable infection. We know vaccination is the best protection against measles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the hospital told Houston ABC station KTRK Monday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur Infection Control and Prevention team immediately identified other children who may have come in contact with this patient to assess their risk and provide clinical recommendations. We have contacted all of those families.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\n \\n \\n \\nIt said the nurse in question was in good standing with the licensing board, but it would not comment on her vaccination status. The hospital says it strongly encourages all staff to obtain the recommended vaccines.\\n \\nMeasles, also known as rubeola, is a highly contagious virus that spreads through respiratory droplets, especially coughing and sneezing, according to medical officials. Early symptoms include a high fever, runny nose, cough and red eyes, preceded by red spots on the face.\\n \\n\"Measles is such a concern, because one, it's preventable. We have a vaccination that can prevent it,\" Dr. Umair Shah, executive director of the Harris County, Texas, Health System, told KTRK. \"And two, it's so easily transmittable to someone else. ... Vaccines save lives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\n \\nThis report appeared in the Wednesday, Aug. 29, 2018, episode of ABC News' daily news podcast \"Start Here.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n\"Start Here\" is a daily ABC News podcast hosted by Brad Mielke featuring original reporting on stories that are driving the national conversation.

John McCain announced he was stopping his cancer treatment.\\n \\nKelli Ward, one of the three candidates looking to fill Sen. Jeff Flake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seat, had a long history of being critical of Sen. John McCain before he passed away on Saturday, and now she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s caught up in a battle of semantics about her comments about the late senator in the two days following his death.\\n \\nIt all started on Friday, when the McCain family announced that he was ending treatment for brain cancer. That same day, Ward launched a two-day campaign bus tour. One of her aides later wrote on Facebook that the timing of the McCain announcement was planned to hurt Ward\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign, and Ward then commented on that post, writing: \"I think they wanted to have a particular narrative that they hope is negative to me.\"\\n \\nThe post and her comment, which were posted hours before McCain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death was announced, have since been deleted, but screengrabs of the post began circulating.\\n \\nWard has placed the blame on the media.\\n \\n \\n \\nAdding to this, another of Ward's social media posts caused controversy today when she tweeted that \"political correctness is like a cancer!\"\\n \\n Political correctness is like a cancer! \\n \\nAt a news conference this afternoon, when asked to address the criticism she is receiving over the comment, especially in light of McCain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fatal brain cancer, she said \"They have nothing to do with each other really, but political correctness is like a cancer.\"\\n \\n \\n \\nWhen asked if the \"political correctness\" tweet was intended to troll social media users, she said \"I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see how it would be trolling, but I can see how you might misunderstand it.\"\\n \\n .@kelliwardaz defends her earlier tweet saying that \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolitical correctness is like a cancer\u00e2\u0080\u009d pic.twitter.com/Ob6LcWr3cX \\nShe also debated the fact that she previously called on McCain to step down in light of his glioblastoma diagnosis, with her argument being that since she said anyone who is unable to serve - be it for health or financial or personal reasons - should step down, and McCain was included in that group, she didn't see that as calling on him to step down.\\n \\n \\n \\nShe also revisited the Facebook comment controversy, saying she wanted to \"set the record straight.\"\\n \\n\"The media quickly ran with a false narrative that I was being insensitive to Senator McCain at a time when he found himself in dire straights. To be clear, my comments were in no way directed at Senator McCain or his family or his team. My comments were in reference to the media, and a lot of you know I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been kinda critical of the media \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not quite as critical as the president has been but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been critical of you as well \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and that the media sometimes might hope for a narrative that might hinder the momentum of our campaign. And that momentum is huge,\" she said.\\n \\n \\n \\n\"Our differences were purely political\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the media they tried to make them out as personal,\" she said of she and McCain.\\n \\n \\n \\nAt one point, someone asked if she were to win Flake's Senate seat, and if Senator Chuck Schumer's proposal to rename the Senate building after McCain passes, then she could be working in a building named after McCain. In response, she seemed to shrug.\\n \\n\"I mean you know that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be up to whoever\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see what happens. You know I have to fly out of the McCain terminal sometimes here so...\" she said, referencing one of the Phoenix airport terminals named after him. 0.101 0.851 0.048   -0.9872\n    */\n\n    Question: 1.

After an internal investigation, this individual is no longer with the organization.\"\\n \\nTexas Children's Hospital in Houston said Monday it stopped a nurse from seeing patients after she reportedly posted about a young boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s condition on an anti-vaccination group on Facebook, according to a statement.\\n \\nShe allegedly wrote about the case on the \"Proud Parents of Unvaccinated Children - Texas\" Facebook page, which has since been deleted.

Actually most of my coworkers and the ER docs saw measles for the first time as well. And honestly, it was rough. The kid was super sick. Sick enough to be admitted to the ICU and he looked miserable.\\n \\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy no means have I changed my vax stance, and I never will. But I just wanted to share my experience and how much worse it was than I expected,\" she added.\\n \\n \\n \\nThe nurse claimed the patient had recently traveled to a region \"where measles is very common\" and speculated that he may have contracted the disease overseas.\\n \\nTexas Children's Hospital responded to the parent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s post on Friday, confirming that it was aware of the post.\\n \\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you for your post. We are aware of this situation and have started a thorough investigation.We take these matters very seriously,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the hospital wrote.

More than 100 people have been diagnosed in the U.S. this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n \\n \\n \\nThe hospital issued a longer statement on Monday, saying it had reached out to children who may have had contact with the infected toddler.\\n \\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA patient treated at Texas Children's Hospital West Campus tested positive for measles. This is a highly-contagious, vaccine-preventable infection. We know vaccination is the best protection against measles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the hospital told Houston ABC station KTRK Monday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur Infection Control and Prevention team immediately identified other children who may have come in contact with this patient to assess their risk and provide clinical recommendations. We have contacted all of those families.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\n \\n \\n \\nIt said the nurse in question was in good standing with the licensing board, but it would not comment on her vaccination status. The hospital says it strongly encourages all staff to obtain the recommended vaccines.\\n \\nMeasles, also known as rubeola, is a highly contagious virus that spreads through respiratory droplets, especially coughing and sneezing, according to medical officials. Early symptoms include a high fever, runny nose, cough and red eyes, preceded by red spots on the face.\\n \\n\"Measles is such a concern, because one, it's preventable. We have a vaccination that can prevent it,\" Dr. Umair Shah, executive director of the Harris County, Texas, Health System, told KTRK. \"And two, it's so easily transmittable to someone else. ...

John McCain announced he was stopping his cancer treatment.\\n \\nKelli Ward, one of the three candidates looking to fill Sen. Jeff Flake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seat, had a long history of being critical of Sen. John McCain before he passed away on Saturday, and now she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s caught up in a battle of semantics about her comments about the late senator in the two days following his death.\\n \\nIt all started on Friday, when the McCain family announced that he was ending treatment for brain cancer. That same day, Ward launched a two-day campaign bus tour. One of her aides later wrote on Facebook that the timing of the McCain announcement was planned to hurt Ward\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign, and Ward then commented on that post, writing: \"I think they wanted to have a particular narrative that they hope is negative to me.\"\\n \\nThe post and her comment, which were posted hours before McCain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death was announced, have since been deleted, but screengrabs of the post began circulating.\\n \\nWard has placed the blame on the media.\\n \\n \\n \\nAdding to this, another of Ward's social media posts caused controversy today when she tweeted that \"political correctness is like a cancer!\"\\n \\n Political correctness is like a cancer! \\n \\nAt a news conference this afternoon, when asked to address the criticism she is receiving over the comment, especially in light of McCain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fatal brain cancer, she said \"They have nothing to do with each other really, but political correctness is like a cancer.\"\\n \\n \\n \\nWhen asked if the \"political correctness\" tweet was intended to troll social media users, she said \"I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see how it would be trolling, but I can see how you might misunderstand it.\"\\n \\n .@kelliwardaz defends her earlier tweet saying that \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolitical correctness is like a cancer\u00e2\u0080\u009d pic.twitter.com/Ob6LcWr3cX \\nShe also debated the fact that she previously called on McCain to step down in light of his glioblastoma diagnosis, with her argument being that since she said anyone who is unable to serve - be it for health or financial or personal reasons - should step down, and McCain was included in that group, she didn't see that as calling on him to step down.\\n \\n \\n \\nShe also revisited the Facebook comment controversy, saying she wanted to \"set the record straight.\"\\n \\n\"The media quickly ran with a false narrative that I was being insensitive to Senator McCain at a time when he found himself in dire straights. To be clear, my comments were in no way directed at Senator McCain or his family or his team. My comments were in reference to the media, and a lot of you know I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been kinda critical of the media \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not quite as critical as the president has been but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been critical of you as well \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and that the media sometimes might hope for a narrative that might hinder the momentum of our campaign. And that momentum is huge,\" she said.\\n \\n \\n \\n\"Our differences were purely political\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the media they tried to make them out as personal,\" she said of she and McCain.\\n \\n \\n \\nAt one point, someone asked if she were to win Flake's Senate seat, and if Senator Chuck Schumer's proposal to rename the Senate building after McCain passes, then she could be working in a building named after McCain. In response, she seemed to shrug.\\n \\n\"I mean you know that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be up to whoever\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see what happens.

After an internal investigation, this individual is no longer with the organization.\"\\n \\nTexas Children's Hospital in Houston said Monday it stopped a nurse from seeing patients after she reportedly posted about a young boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s condition on an anti-vaccination group on Facebook, according to a statement.\\n \\nShe allegedly wrote about the case on the \"Proud Parents of Unvaccinated Children - Texas\" Facebook page, which has since been deleted. A concerned parent posted screenshots of the unidentified nurse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments on the hospital's Facebook page late Friday.\\n \\n \\n \\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy for us nonvaxxers to make assumptions but most of us have never and will never see one of theses diseases,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the self-identified nurse wrote, according to the screenshots. \"[F]or the first time in my career I saw measles this week. Actually most of my coworkers and the ER docs saw measles for the first time as well. And honestly, it was rough. The kid was super sick. Sick enough to be admitted to the ICU and he looked miserable.\\n \\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy no means have I changed my vax stance, and I never will. But I just wanted to share my experience and how much worse it was than I expected,\" she added.\\n \\n \\n \\nThe nurse claimed the patient had recently traveled to a region \"where measles is very common\" and speculated that he may have contracted the disease overseas.\\n \\nTexas Children's Hospital responded to the parent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s post on Friday, confirming that it was aware of the post.\\n \\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you for your post. We are aware of this situation and have started a thorough investigation.We take these matters very seriously,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the hospital wrote. It edited the statement later to add: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe views of this employee do not represent that of the organization.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\n \\nIf confirmed, the toddler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diagnosis would mark the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eighth measles case this year. More than 100 people have been diagnosed in the U.S. this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n \\n \\n \\nThe hospital issued a longer statement on Monday, saying it had reached out to children who may have had contact with the infected toddler.\\n \\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA patient treated at Texas Children's Hospital West Campus tested positive for measles. This is a highly-contagious, vaccine-preventable infection. We know vaccination is the best protection against measles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the hospital told Houston ABC station KTRK Monday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur Infection Control and Prevention team immediately identified other children who may have come in contact with this patient to assess their risk and provide clinical recommendations. We have contacted all of those families.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\n \\n \\n \\nIt said the nurse in question was in good standing with the licensing board, but it would not comment on her vaccination status. The hospital says it strongly encourages all staff to obtain the recommended vaccines.\\n \\nMeasles, also known as rubeola, is a highly contagious virus that spreads through respiratory droplets, especially coughing and sneezing, according to medical officials. Early symptoms include a high fever, runny nose, cough and red eyes, preceded by red spots on the face.\\n \\n\"Measles is such a concern, because one, it's preventable. We have a vaccination that can prevent it,\" Dr. Umair Shah, executive director of the Harris County, Texas, Health System, told KTRK. \"And two, it's so easily transmittable to someone else. ... Vaccines save lives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\n \\nThis report appeared in the Wednesday, Aug. 29, 2018, episode of ABC News' daily news podcast \"Start Here.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n\"Start Here\" is a daily ABC News podcast hosted by Brad Mielke featuring original reporting on stories that are driving the national conversation.

John McCain announced he was stopping his cancer treatment.\\n \\nKelli Ward, one of the three candidates looking to fill Sen. Jeff Flake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seat, had a long history of being critical of Sen. John McCain before he passed away on Saturday, and now she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s caught up in a battle of semantics about her comments about the late senator in the two days following his death.\\n \\nIt all started on Friday, when the McCain family announced that he was ending treatment for brain cancer. That same day, Ward launched a two-day campaign bus tour. One of her aides later wrote on Facebook that the timing of the McCain announcement was planned to hurt Ward\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign, and Ward then commented on that post, writing: \"I think they wanted to have a particular narrative that they hope is negative to me.\"\\n \\nThe post and her comment, which were posted hours before McCain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death was announced, have since been deleted, but screengrabs of the post began circulating.\\n \\nWard has placed the blame on the media.\\n \\n \\n \\nAdding to this, another of Ward's social media posts caused controversy today when she tweeted that \"political correctness is like a cancer!\"\\n \\n Political correctness is like a cancer! \\n \\nAt a news conference this afternoon, when asked to address the criticism she is receiving over the comment, especially in light of McCain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fatal brain cancer, she said \"They have nothing to do with each other really, but political correctness is like a cancer.\"\\n \\n \\n \\nWhen asked if the \"political correctness\" tweet was intended to troll social media users, she said \"I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see how it would be trolling, but I can see how you might misunderstand it.\"\\n \\n .@kelliwardaz defends her earlier tweet saying that \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolitical correctness is like a cancer\u00e2\u0080\u009d pic.twitter.com/Ob6LcWr3cX \\nShe also debated the fact that she previously called on McCain to step down in light of his glioblastoma diagnosis, with her argument being that since she said anyone who is unable to serve - be it for health or financial or personal reasons - should step down, and McCain was included in that group, she didn't see that as calling on him to step down.\\n \\n \\n \\nShe also revisited the Facebook comment controversy, saying she wanted to \"set the record straight.\"\\n \\n\"The media quickly ran with a false narrative that I was being insensitive to Senator McCain at a time when he found himself in dire straights. To be clear, my comments were in no way directed at Senator McCain or his family or his team. My comments were in reference to the media, and a lot of you know I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been kinda critical of the media \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not quite as critical as the president has been but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been critical of you as well \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and that the media sometimes might hope for a narrative that might hinder the momentum of our campaign. And that momentum is huge,\" she said.\\n \\n \\n \\n\"Our differences were purely political\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the media they tried to make them out as personal,\" she said of she and McCain.\\n \\n \\n \\nAt one point, someone asked if she were to win Flake's Senate seat, and if Senator Chuck Schumer's proposal to rename the Senate building after McCain passes, then she could be working in a building named after McCain. In response, she seemed to shrug.\\n \\n\"I mean you know that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be up to whoever\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see what happens. You know I have to fly out of the McCain terminal sometimes here so...\" she said, referencing one of the Phoenix airport terminals named after him. 0.101 0.851 0.048   -0.9872\n    */\n\n    Question: 3. Is there any correlation between the \"neg\" and \"pos\" sentiment score columns? If so, what is the correlation coefficient?\n    Constraints: Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) to assess the strength and direction of the linear relationship between 'neg' and 'pos' sentiment scores. If the Pearson correlation coefficient (absolute value) is close to 1, it means that there exists a strong correlation. If it is close to 0, it means that there exists a weak or no correlation. If the coefficient is positive, the correlation is positive; if negative, the correlation is negative.\n    ",

After an internal investigation, this individual is no longer with the organization.\"\\n \\nTexas Children's Hospital in Houston said Monday it stopped a nurse from seeing patients after she reportedly posted about a young boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s condition on an anti-vaccination group on Facebook, according to a statement.\\n \\nShe allegedly wrote about the case on the \"Proud Parents of Unvaccinated Children - Texas\" Facebook page, which has since been deleted.

Actually most of my coworkers and the ER docs saw measles for the first time as well. And honestly, it was rough. The kid was super sick. Sick enough to be admitted to the ICU and he looked miserable.\\n \\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy no means have I changed my vax stance, and I never will. But I just wanted to share my experience and how much worse it was than I expected,\" she added.\\n \\n \\n \\nThe nurse claimed the patient had recently traveled to a region \"where measles is very common\" and speculated that he may have contracted the disease overseas.\\n \\nTexas Children's Hospital responded to the parent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s post on Friday, confirming that it was aware of the post.\\n \\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you for your post. We are aware of this situation and have started a thorough investigation.We take these matters very seriously,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the hospital wrote. It edited the statement later to add: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe views of this employee do not represent that of the organization.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\n \\nIf confirmed, the toddler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diagnosis would mark the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eighth measles case this year. More than 100 people have been diagnosed in the U.S. this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n \\n \\n \\nThe hospital issued a longer statement on Monday, saying it had reached out to children who may have had contact with the infected toddler.\\n \\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA patient treated at Texas Children's Hospital West Campus tested positive for measles. This is a highly-contagious, vaccine-preventable infection. We know vaccination is the best protection against measles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the hospital told Houston ABC station KTRK Monday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur Infection Control and Prevention team immediately identified other children who may have come in contact with this patient to assess their risk and provide clinical recommendations. We have contacted all of those families.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\n \\n \\n \\nIt said the nurse in question was in good standing with the licensing board, but it would not comment on her vaccination status. The hospital says it strongly encourages all staff to obtain the recommended vaccines.\\n \\nMeasles, also known as rubeola, is a highly contagious virus that spreads through respiratory droplets, especially coughing and sneezing, according to medical officials. Early symptoms include a high fever, runny nose, cough and red eyes, preceded by red spots on the face.\\n \\n\"Measles is such a concern, because one, it's preventable. We have a vaccination that can prevent it,\" Dr. Umair Shah, executive director of the Harris County, Texas, Health System, told KTRK. \"And two, it's so easily transmittable to someone else. ...

John McCain announced he was stopping his cancer treatment.\\n \\nKelli Ward, one of the three candidates looking to fill Sen. Jeff Flake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seat, had a long history of being critical of Sen. John McCain before he passed away on Saturday, and now she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s caught up in a battle of semantics about her comments about the late senator in the two days following his death.\\n \\nIt all started on Friday, when the McCain family announced that he was ending treatment for brain cancer. That same day, Ward launched a two-day campaign bus tour. One of her aides later wrote on Facebook that the timing of the McCain announcement was planned to hurt Ward\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign, and Ward then commented on that post, writing: \"I think they wanted to have a particular narrative that they hope is negative to me.\"\\n \\nThe post and her comment, which were posted hours before McCain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death was announced, have since been deleted, but screengrabs of the post began circulating.\\n \\nWard has placed the blame on the media.\\n \\n \\n \\nAdding to this, another of Ward's social media posts caused controversy today when she tweeted that \"political correctness is like a cancer!\"\\n \\n Political correctness is like a cancer! \\n \\nAt a news conference this afternoon, when asked to address the criticism she is receiving over the comment, especially in light of McCain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fatal brain cancer, she said \"They have nothing to do with each other really, but political correctness is like a cancer.\"\\n \\n \\n \\nWhen asked if the \"political correctness\" tweet was intended to troll social media users, she said \"I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see how it would be trolling, but I can see how you might misunderstand it.\"\\n \\n .@kelliwardaz defends her earlier tweet saying that \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolitical correctness is like a cancer\u00e2\u0080\u009d pic.twitter.com/Ob6LcWr3cX \\nShe also debated the fact that she previously called on McCain to step down in light of his glioblastoma diagnosis, with her argument being that since she said anyone who is unable to serve - be it for health or financial or personal reasons - should step down, and McCain was included in that group, she didn't see that as calling on him to step down.\\n \\n \\n \\nShe also revisited the Facebook comment controversy, saying she wanted to \"set the record straight.\"\\n \\n\"The media quickly ran with a false narrative that I was being insensitive to Senator McCain at a time when he found himself in dire straights. To be clear, my comments were in no way directed at Senator McCain or his family or his team. My comments were in reference to the media, and a lot of you know I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been kinda critical of the media \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not quite as critical as the president has been but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been critical of you as well \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and that the media sometimes might hope for a narrative that might hinder the momentum of our campaign. And that momentum is huge,\" she said.\\n \\n \\n \\n\"Our differences were purely political\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the media they tried to make them out as personal,\" she said of she and McCain.\\n \\n \\n \\nAt one point, someone asked if she were to win Flake's Senate seat, and if Senator Chuck Schumer's proposal to rename the Senate building after McCain passes, then she could be working in a building named after McCain. In response, she seemed to shrug.\\n \\n\"I mean you know that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be up to whoever\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see what happens.

After an internal investigation, this individual is no longer with the organization.\"\\n \\nTexas Children's Hospital in Houston said Monday it stopped a nurse from seeing patients after she reportedly posted about a young boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s condition on an anti-vaccination group on Facebook, according to a statement.\\n \\nShe allegedly wrote about the case on the \"Proud Parents of Unvaccinated Children - Texas\" Facebook page, which has since been deleted. A concerned parent posted screenshots of the unidentified nurse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments on the hospital's Facebook page late Friday.\\n \\n \\n \\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy for us nonvaxxers to make assumptions but most of us have never and will never see one of theses diseases,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the self-identified nurse wrote, according to the screenshots. \"[F]or the first time in my career I saw measles this week. Actually most of my coworkers and the ER docs saw measles for the first time as well. And honestly, it was rough. The kid was super sick. Sick enough to be admitted to the ICU and he looked miserable.\\n \\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy no means have I changed my vax stance, and I never will. But I just wanted to share my experience and how much worse it was than I expected,\" she added.\\n \\n \\n \\nThe nurse claimed the patient had recently traveled to a region \"where measles is very common\" and speculated that he may have contracted the disease overseas.\\n \\nTexas Children's Hospital responded to the parent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s post on Friday, confirming that it was aware of the post.\\n \\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you for your post. We are aware of this situation and have started a thorough investigation.We take these matters very seriously,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the hospital wrote. It edited the statement later to add: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe views of this employee do not represent that of the organization.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\n \\nIf confirmed, the toddler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diagnosis would mark the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eighth measles case this year. More than 100 people have been diagnosed in the U.S. this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n \\n \\n \\nThe hospital issued a longer statement on Monday, saying it had reached out to children who may have had contact with the infected toddler.\\n \\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA patient treated at Texas Children's Hospital West Campus tested positive for measles. This is a highly-contagious, vaccine-preventable infection. We know vaccination is the best protection against measles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the hospital told Houston ABC station KTRK Monday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur Infection Control and Prevention team immediately identified other children who may have come in contact with this patient to assess their risk and provide clinical recommendations. We have contacted all of those families.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\n \\n \\n \\nIt said the nurse in question was in good standing with the licensing board, but it would not comment on her vaccination status. The hospital says it strongly encourages all staff to obtain the recommended vaccines.\\n \\nMeasles, also known as rubeola, is a highly contagious virus that spreads through respiratory droplets, especially coughing and sneezing, according to medical officials. Early symptoms include a high fever, runny nose, cough and red eyes, preceded by red spots on the face.\\n \\n\"Measles is such a concern, because one, it's preventable. We have a vaccination that can prevent it,\" Dr. Umair Shah, executive director of the Harris County, Texas, Health System, told KTRK. \"And two, it's so easily transmittable to someone else. ... Vaccines save lives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\\n \\nThis report appeared in the Wednesday, Aug. 29, 2018, episode of ABC News' daily news podcast \"Start Here.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n\"Start Here\" is a daily ABC News podcast hosted by Brad Mielke featuring original reporting on stories that are driving the national conversation.

John McCain announced he was stopping his cancer treatment.\\n \\nKelli Ward, one of the three candidates looking to fill Sen. Jeff Flake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seat, had a long history of being critical of Sen. John McCain before he passed away on Saturday, and now she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s caught up in a battle of semantics about her comments about the late senator in the two days following his death.\\n \\nIt all started on Friday, when the McCain family announced that he was ending treatment for brain cancer. That same day, Ward launched a two-day campaign bus tour. One of her aides later wrote on Facebook that the timing of the McCain announcement was planned to hurt Ward\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign, and Ward then commented on that post, writing: \"I think they wanted to have a particular narrative that they hope is negative to me.\"\\n \\nThe post and her comment, which were posted hours before McCain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death was announced, have since been deleted, but screengrabs of the post began circulating.\\n \\nWard has placed the blame on the media.\\n \\n \\n \\nAdding to this, another of Ward's social media posts caused controversy today when she tweeted that \"political correctness is like a cancer!\"\\n \\n Political correctness is like a cancer! \\n \\nAt a news conference this afternoon, when asked to address the criticism she is receiving over the comment, especially in light of McCain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fatal brain cancer, she said \"They have nothing to do with each other really, but political correctness is like a cancer.\"\\n \\n \\n \\nWhen asked if the \"political correctness\" tweet was intended to troll social media users, she said \"I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see how it would be trolling, but I can see how you might misunderstand it.\"\\n \\n .@kelliwardaz defends her earlier tweet saying that \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolitical correctness is like a cancer\u00e2\u0080\u009d pic.twitter.com/Ob6LcWr3cX \\nShe also debated the fact that she previously called on McCain to step down in light of his glioblastoma diagnosis, with her argument being that since she said anyone who is unable to serve - be it for health or financial or personal reasons - should step down, and McCain was included in that group, she didn't see that as calling on him to step down.\\n \\n \\n \\nShe also revisited the Facebook comment controversy, saying she wanted to \"set the record straight.\"\\n \\n\"The media quickly ran with a false narrative that I was being insensitive to Senator McCain at a time when he found himself in dire straights. To be clear, my comments were in no way directed at Senator McCain or his family or his team. My comments were in reference to the media, and a lot of you know I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been kinda critical of the media \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not quite as critical as the president has been but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been critical of you as well \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and that the media sometimes might hope for a narrative that might hinder the momentum of our campaign. And that momentum is huge,\" she said.\\n \\n \\n \\n\"Our differences were purely political\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the media they tried to make them out as personal,\" she said of she and McCain.\\n \\n \\n \\nAt one point, someone asked if she were to win Flake's Senate seat, and if Senator Chuck Schumer's proposal to rename the Senate building after McCain passes, then she could be working in a building named after McCain. In response, she seemed to shrug.\\n \\n\"I mean you know that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be up to whoever\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see what happens. You know I have to fly out of the McCain terminal sometimes here so...\" she said, referencing one of the Phoenix airport terminals named after him. 0.101 0.851 0.048   -0.9872\n    */\n\n    Question: 2.
